# CLAUDE.md

Project-level guidance for Claude (and any new engineer) working in this repo.
Pair with the longer docs in [`docs/`](docs/) for full context.

## What this project is

A multi-spreadsheet Google Apps Script stack that ingests call detail records
(CDR) from a telephony provider, aggregates them into per-agent per-day
metrics ("DQE"), and serves them to ~14 department managers via a web app.
Currently migrating: a new web-app **Department Dashboard** replaces a legacy
DQE Report spreadsheet, one report at a time.

- **Owner / admin**: Robin Choudhury (`robin.choudhury@universalmedsupply.com`)
- **Domain**: Universal Med Supply (Google Workspace)
- **Lifecycle**: active development; small internal user base (<20)

## Read first

For deeper context, in priority order:

- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — data flow across CDR
  Import, CDR Report, Department Dashboard, Neon Postgres. Read this first
  when chasing a bug to figure out which layer is involved.
- [`docs/known-issues.md`](docs/known-issues.md) — institutional memory.
  Fixed bugs, design rules, drift risks. Read before changing the source
  pipeline or the dashboard's data layer.
- [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) — time windows, aggregation
  rules, naming conventions, scope semantics.
- [`README.md`](README.md) — clasp setup + deploy flow.

## Key commands

```bash
# Department Dashboard (web app) deploy
clasp push -f                                # from repo root
# Then in the Apps Script editor:
# Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil → Version: New version → Deploy

# Sibling project deploys
cd apps-script/cdr-report  && clasp push -f
cd apps-script/cdr-import  && clasp push -f
cd apps-script/dqe-report  && clasp push -f   # frozen — cleanup deploys only

# No tests. Verification is manual deploy + smoke-test against
# Regression Scenarios in the Cycle Workflow Config below.
```

## Common Gotchas

A few things that have bitten us repeatedly. See `docs/known-issues.md` for full detail.

- **Spreadsheet TZ ≠ script TZ**. The CDR Report spreadsheet is on
  `America/Mexico_City`; the script is on `America/Chicago`. Duration cells
  (TTT, ATT, AvgAbdWait, CSRAvgAbdWait) get a phantom +36:36 offset if you
  read them via `getValue()`. **Always use `getDisplayValues()`** for those
  columns and parse the H:MM:SS string directly.
- **`clasp push -f` does NOT delete remote files** that are absent locally.
  Removing files from an Apps Script project requires manual deletion in
  the web editor.
- **No write paths via `google.script.run`**. Every public-callable
  function must be read-only. Helpers that touch spreadsheet state end in
  `_` — Apps Script blocks trailing-underscore names from RPC. Belt-and-
  suspenders against the "Execute as: Me" model letting any visitor reach
  through Robin's permissions.
- **Roster cells embed extensions**: `DO NOT EDIT!` cells follow
  `"Name, ext1, ext2"`. Take everything before the first comma as the name;
  digit-only tokens after are queue extensions.
- **Agent-name match is exact** — no case folding, no whitespace
  normalization, no alias mapping. A typo on either side silently drops
  the agent from their dept's view.
- **ATT is the simple mean of stored per-row ATT values**, NOT weighted
  `TTT / Answered`. The source's stored ATT denominator is sometimes ≠
  Answered (a known source-pipeline quirk).
- **`neonWrite.js` is duplicated** between `apps-script/cdr-report/` and
  `apps-script/cdr-import/`. Currently byte-identical. Any change to one
  is a two-file edit; `diff` before editing.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Web app deploys as "Execute as: Me"** with **"Access: Anyone within
  domain"**. The script runs with the deployer's spreadsheet permissions,
  so managers never get direct access to CDR Report. Read-only safety
  relies on the trailing-underscore convention plus auth re-resolution
  inside every public function.
- **`SPREADSHEET_ID` lives in Script Properties**, not in code. Lets dev
  and prod copies of the dashboard run from the same source without
  edits.
- **Per-project gitignored `.clasp.json`**. Each developer keeps their own
  `scriptId` locally; pulls never conflict on it. Template at
  `.clasp.example.json`.
- **CacheService tiers**: 5 min on aggregated dashboard responses,
  60 sec on auth lookups. Cache key is versioned (`summary:vN:...`); bump
  N on any aggregation-rule change to invalidate stale entries instantly.
- **Scope toggle (`roster | queue | both`)**: managers can see strictly
  their roster, anyone who handled their queue extensions, or the union.
  Default is `roster` (matches the legacy DQE Report's behavior).
- **DQE Report Legacy is FROZEN**. Being migrated to Department Dashboard
  one report at a time. No improvements there — only deletions as items
  finish migrating.

## Operator State Checklist

When something looks wrong, before assuming a code bug, check:

1. Did the daily ingest run? Verify the latest date in `DQE Historical Data` (CDR Report sheet).
2. Did the dashboard's deployed version include the latest code? Apps
   Script editor → Deploy → Manage deployments → check the timestamp.
3. Did the user actually have access? `Access Control` sheet rows are
   case-sensitive on email.
4. Is the cache stale? Bump cache version in `Data.gs` or wait 5 min.
5. Did the source-pipeline bugs (window inclusion / ATT denominator / leg
   attribution — see `known-issues.md`) get re-introduced? Spot-check Sonia
   2026-03-09: TTT should be `0:15:03`, ATT should be `0:03:01`.

### Invariant Library
INV-01 | No public function (callable via google.script.run) writes to any spreadsheet; all write-capable helpers end in `_` so Apps Script blocks them from RPC. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-02 | Duration columns (TTT, ATT, AvgAbdWait, CSRAvgAbdWait) are read via getDisplayValues(), not getValue(), to bypass spreadsheet-vs-script TZ mismatch. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-03 | DO NOT EDIT! roster cells follow the format "Name, ext1, ext2, …" — name is everything before the first comma; subsequent digit-only tokens are extensions. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-04 | Agent-name match between DQE Historical Data Col C and DO NOT EDIT! roster cells is exact (case + whitespace sensitive); no alias normalization. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-05 | Per-agent ATT in the dashboard is the simple mean of per-row stored ATT values, NOT TTT/Answered weighted. Source ATT denominator sometimes ≠ Answered. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-06 | Work window for TTT/ATT/Missed/Answered is 6:30 AM – 3:00 PM PST (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM CST), hardcoded as DQE_WINDOW_START/DQE_WINDOW_END. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
INV-07 | TTT/ATT loop in buildDQEHistoricalData iterates `windowLegs` (in-window subset), not all-day `legs`, to match Answered's denominator. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
INV-08 | TTT attribution uses each agent's own leg.talkSec on the parent call via findAgentTalkOnParent, NOT parent.talkSec (max across all legs). | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
INV-09 | Cache key in Data.gs is versioned (`summary:vN:...`); bump N on any aggregation rule change to invalidate stale caches. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-10 | HISTORICAL_COLS in department-dashboard/Config.gs must match actual column positions in DQE Historical Data (Date=2, Agent=3, TTT=9, ATT=10, AVG_ABD_WAIT=33, CSR_AVG_ABD_WAIT=34). | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-11 | ROSTER constants pin DO NOT EDIT! layout: HEADER_ROW=1, DATA_START_ROW=2, DEPT_FIRST_COL=6. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-12 | setup() in Department Dashboard is idempotent — creates Access Control sheet only if missing, never overwrites existing rows. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-13 | Web app deployment is "Execute as: Me" + "Anyone within domain"; deployer's spreadsheet permissions back the script. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-14 | SPREADSHEET_ID is read from Script Properties, not hardcoded; missing property = clear error at request time. | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-15 | Per-project .clasp.json files are gitignored at any depth; scriptIds stay out of the repo. | Subsystem: operational/cross-cutting
INV-16 | neonWrite.js is duplicated between cdr-report/ and cdr-import/; must stay byte-identical. Any change requires a two-file edit. | Subsystem: CDR Reporting Tools / CDR Import
INV-17 | `clasp push -f` does NOT delete remote files absent locally; removing files from a project requires manual web-editor deletion. | Subsystem: operational/cross-cutting
INV-18 | Missed Calls Report chart range is 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM CST in 30-minute buckets (18 total). | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
INV-19 | DQE_EXCLUDED_AGENTS allowlist in buildDQEHistoricalData.js is the canonical source for pseudo-agent exclusions; additions go upstream, not downstream. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
INV-20 | Time-slot columns K-AC in DQE Historical Data store CST timestamps (already PST→CST converted); downstream code must NOT re-convert. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline / Department Dashboard
INV-21 | parentMap in buildDQEHistoricalData builds from rows with parentId='N/A' or ''; each parent leg's calleeName must be captured for findAgentTalkOnParent. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
INV-22 | DQE Report Legacy is frozen — accepts only deletions and minimal menu cleanups during migration; no new features or improvements. | Subsystem: DQE Report Legacy
INV-23 | Queue-sentinel rows in DQE Historical Data carry queue-only abandoned data (no agent rang). Agent Name (col C) holds a queue identifier (`A_Q_*` or `Backup CSR`); col D holds the queue's extensions; K-AC, AD, AF are populated normally; cols E-J and AG/AH are 0/"0:00:00". Consumers must filter these out by agent-name pattern: the main per-agent dashboard (Data.gs) and Diagnostics (whyNoMatches) skip them; MissedCallsReport.gs reads them specifically for the queue-only section. | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline / Department Dashboard

### Policy Configuration
Policy threshold: 6/10
Consecutive cycles: 2

### Regression Scenarios
S1 | Manager loads own-dept dashboard | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Manager opens the deployed web app URL.
    - Confirm header shows their dept + email + blue "manager" tag.
    - Confirm From/To default to current-month-to-date; agent table populates within 3 seconds.
    - Confirm scope toggle defaults to "Roster".
  Expected: only that manager's dept agents appear; info-line shows "fresh read" first load, "cache hit" on immediate refresh.

S2 | Admin switches departments | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Admin opens deployed URL.
    - Confirm dept dropdown lists all departments.
    - Switch from default to a different dept.
  Expected: agent table re-fetches and re-renders within 3s; info-line shows "fresh read".

S3 | Unmapped user gets access-denied | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - User not in Access Control and not in ADMIN_EMAILS opens the URL.
  Expected: red access-denied card with their email + admin contact + mailto button.

S4 | Missed Calls Report renders for a known date | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Open dashboard for a dept with known missed calls in range.
    - Click "Missed Calls" button.
  Expected: modal opens; 18-bucket bar chart (8 AM-5 PM CST); per-agent cards with timestamps; abandoned ones red + 🚨.

S5 | Daily DQE aggregation completes for a typical day | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline
  Steps:
    - In CDR Report Apps Script, manually run buildDQEHistoricalData for a day's Raw Data.
  Expected: new rows in DQE Historical Data; Neon mirror succeeds; no failure email; per-agent TTT ≈ ATT × Answered (±1s rounding).

S6 | Scope toggle captures queue-only floaters | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Open dashboard for a dept with known floaters.
    - Switch scope to "Queue" or "Both".
  Expected: floaters appear with "(queue-only)" suffix; Diagnostics panel lists them.

S7 | Source pipeline numbers match dashboard | Subsystem: CDR DQE Pipeline → Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Verify Sonia 2026-03-09: source TTT/ATT vs dashboard TTT/ATT.
  Expected: 0:15:03 / 0:03:01 on both sides.

S8 | New manager visible within 60s of being added to Access Control | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Add a row (Email | Department | Notes) to Access Control sheet.
    - Have that user open the URL.
  Expected: dashboard loads as manager within 60s (AUTH_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS).

S9 | clasp push from sibling subdir deploys only that project | Subsystem: operational
  Steps:
    - `cd apps-script/cdr-report` → trivial change → `clasp push -f`.
  Expected: only that project receives the change; Department Dashboard unaffected.

S10 | setup() is safely re-runnable | Subsystem: Department Dashboard
  Steps:
    - Run setup() in editor.
    - Run again.
  Expected: first run creates Access Control if missing; second logs "already exists, skipping" — no data overwrite.

### Frozen Subsystems
- DQE Report Legacy — manager-facing reports in `apps-script/dqe-report/`. Frozen because being migrated into Department Dashboard one report at a time (FAQ migrated; Missed Calls Report in progress as of this setup). Replacement: Department Dashboard. Unfreeze conditions: migration abandoned (unlikely), or a discovered bug in a not-yet-migrated report that affects manager decisions immediately.

### Deploy Command
Department Dashboard: `clasp push -f` from repo root, then Apps Script editor → Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil → Version: New version → Deploy
CDR DQE Pipeline: `cd apps-script/cdr-report && clasp push -f`
CDR Reporting Tools: `cd apps-script/cdr-report && clasp push -f` (same Apps Script project as CDR DQE Pipeline)
CDR Import: `cd apps-script/cdr-import && clasp push -f`
DQE Report Legacy: `cd apps-script/dqe-report && clasp push -f` (frozen — cleanup deploys only)
